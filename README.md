Building My Own Google Assistant with Python
During my internship program at Hex Software, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project: creating a Google Assistant‑like tool using Python programming in VS Code.It’s amazing how a few lines of Python can transform into a powerful assistant that makes everyday tasks easier. This internship project not only sharpened my coding skills but also inspired me to explore more in AI and automation.
